# Building Apps with gRPC

## Introduction

Microservices-based applications consist of multiple services and are built with a variety of programming languages. Based on the business use case, you can pick the most appropriate technology to build your service. gRPC can be one of those choices.

Today I'm going to chat with Sourahb to find out more about gRPC and ASP.NET Core apps.

* Where does gRPC come from?
* Why gRPC? Are there other RPC technologies?
* How is gRPC cloud native?
* Doesn’t gRPC already work on .NET? What are we doing here?
* What’s next?

* WCF - is this the new version?
* Advantages over REST / JSON based APIs?
