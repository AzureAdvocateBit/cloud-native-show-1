# What is Cloud Native

## Intro

Cloud Native â€“ what is it? Loosley defined, it's running scalable applications in the cloud using containers, microservices, and immutable infrastructure managed with through devops. I'm going to talk to Brendan Burns and find out what it really means today.

## Defining Cloud Native

As [defined](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/DEFINITION.md#cncf-cloud-native-definition-v10) by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)

> _Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.
> These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil._

1. What is your definition of Cloud Native?
2. The terminology is easy to throw around - microservices, containers, serverless. Are we oversimplifying distributed applications with these words?
3. Is this just SOA redifined?
4. Tooling is hard, at first glance it's all command line; is tooling the next goal?
5. What's next? Is the cloud the end goal or are we pushing somewhere else?
