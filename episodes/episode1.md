# The "What" and "Why" of Cloud Native and .NET Core

## Intro

Part 1: Cloud Native â€“ what is it? Loosley defined, it's running scalable applications in the cloud using containers, microservices, and immutable infrastructure managed with through devops. I'm going to talk to Brendan Burns and find out what it really means today.

Part 2: Each service of a cloud native application is developed with the language and/or framework best suited for the job. APIs, serverless, web applications, and streaming services are a few examples. .NET Core is language built right on campus, let's go talk to Scott Hunter to find out why NET Core should be a first thought for cloud native apps.

## What is Cloud Native

As [defined](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/DEFINITION.md#cncf-cloud-native-definition-v10) by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)

>*Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.
>These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.*

1. What is your definition of Cloud Native?
2. Is this just SOA redifined?
3. Tooling is hard, at first glance it's all command line; is tooling the next goal?
4. What's next?

## Why .NET Core

1. .NET Core was written from the ground up with a cloud first approach, what were the first goals?
2. Peformance
3. Anywhere, on anything and for any purpose
4. .NET Core 3.0
