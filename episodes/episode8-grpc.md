# Building Microservices with gRPC and .NET

## Introduction

Microservices-based applications consist of multiple services and are built with a variety of programming languages. Based on the business use case, you can pick the most appropriate technology to build your service. gRPC can be one of those choices.

Today I'm going to chat with Sourahb to find out more about gRPC and ASP.NET Core apps.
