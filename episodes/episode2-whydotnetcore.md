## Intro

Welcome to another episode of the Cloud Native Show. APIs, serverless and streaming services are just a few examples of the types of apps you'd build using best of class languages.  .NET Core is language built right on campus, let's go talk to Scott Hunter to find out why .NET Core should be a first thought for cloud native apps.

## Why .NET Core

1. .NET Core was written from the ground up with a cloud first approach, what were the first goals?
2. How has .NET Core enabled cloud-native development?
3. What were some of the motivations to get .NET Core such that it could run on Linux?
4. Anywhere, on anything and for any purpose
5. .NET Core 3.0 - Worker templates, gRPC, any other improvements for cloud native dev?
