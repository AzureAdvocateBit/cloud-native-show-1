# Cloud Native .NET Show

Why .NET Core for Cloud Native? That is what we are here to show you. In this series, we talk with industry experts, the engineers and customers building apps and using .NET Core for cloud native solutions.

In each episode, we'll have a conversation about the concepts of why and how each aspect of cloud native practices can be used to construct a robust, scalable and reliable application using .NET Core.

Beyond just talking about the ideas, join us on Twitch every few weeks to build a real application using the practices and components our guests discuss with us.
